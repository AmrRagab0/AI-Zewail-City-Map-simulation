# AI-Zewail-City-Map-simulation
This is an Artificial Intelligence course project. It simulates a Zewail City map and uses the following search algorithms to navigate from one point to another inside the map.
In this project, We folllow these steps:
1. Define the abstraction of the problem using the state space representation, successor
function, set of actions.
2. Find the best route using the following uninformed search algorithms
o BFS
o DFS
o IDS
3. Reflect on the results of the three algorithms above.
4. Define TWO reasonable heuristic functions and justify your choice, then use them to find
the best route using:
o Greedy best-first
o A*
5. Apply hill climbing (or any of its variants) and simulated annealing to find the best route.
6. Compare between the results of all used methods (time needed to find a solution, showing if it is
complete and optimal)
7. For each case, we presented a search tree of our solutions.
